      <p>The USA is one of the largest importers of cotton T-shirts. However, these shirts may not be ethically made. They might be made with child labor, workers in poor working conditions, or other unethical practices.</p>

      <i>It's Incredibly Hard To Prove That Clothing Is "Ethically Made"</i>
      <p>By Anne D'innocenzio</p>
      <p>Published by The New York Times</p>
      <br>
      <b>Relevant information:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>“...ethically made clothes make up a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the overall $1 trillion global fashion industry.”</li>
        <li>“...major chains typically use a complex web of suppliers in countries such as Bangladesh, which often contract business to other factories.”</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>Research notes:</b>
      <p>Clothing brands do not know how their clothes are made. The factories they use usually delegate their demand to other factories, which is not tracked by the seller, so they have no bearing of how and where their clothes are made.</p>
      <br>
      <b>Additional research questions:</b>
      <ul>
      	<li>About what percent of factories have unsafe working conditions?</li>
		<li>What are working conditions like in some factories compared to others?</li>

      <i>An Apparel Factory Defies Sweatshop Label, But Can It Thrive?</i>
      <p>By Steven Greenhouse</p>
      <p>Published by The New York Times</p>
      <br>
      <b>Relevant information:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>“Ms. Castillo had long dreamed of a bigger, sturdier house, but three months ago something happened that finally made it possible: she landed a job at one of the world’s most unusual garment factories. Industry experts say it is a pioneer in the developing world because it pays a ‘living wage’ - in this case, three times the average pay of the country’s apparel workers - and allows workers to join a union without a fight.”</li>
        <li>“The factory is a high-minded experiment, a response to appeals from myriad university officials and students activists that the garment industry stop using poverty-wage sweatshops. It has 120 employees and is owned by Knight Apparel, a privately held company based in Spartanburg, S.C., that is the leading supplier of college-logo apparel to American universities, according to the Collegiate Licensing Company.”</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>Research notes:</b>
      <p>A factory for Knights Apparel is trying to give employees a better working experience by giving them living wages and allowing them to join unions. This has led to people who work at the factory being able to move up in society instead of being stuck at the bottom.</p>
      <br>
      <b>Additional research questions:</b>
      <ul>
      	<li>How many factories give employees a decent wage?</li>
		<li>What are working conditions like in this factory?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br><br><br>
    <h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>
    <br>
    All in all, I concluded that it is a rare thing for employees to be treated fairly in clothing factories. Throughout my research, I have heard many stories of factory workers working in terrible conditions such as being forced to use heavy machinery or toxic chemicals, and many stories of these workers being paid a pittance for their toil. Therefore, I believe that working conditions in the garment industry are generally very bad.
    <br><br>
    <h1><b>Advice for consumers</b></h1>
    <br>
    I would advise consumers to try to check if their clothing brands have been accused of using unfair labor in order to determine if they shoud be bought from. Even one person boycotting a clothing brand can make a difference.
